#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering approaches to the design, development, testing, and maintenance of software systems.
Importance of software engineering include;
  - Reliability: Software engineering ensures that software systems are developed with a focus on robustness,
  - Efficiency: By using practices like code reuse, and automation, software engineers can create more efficient development processes.
  - User-Centered Design: Effective software engineering prioritizes the user experience, ensuring that software is intuitive, functional, and meets user needs. 

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
- The Introduction of Structured Programming: Structured programming was introduced as a method to improve software development practices and solve the "software crisis" of the 1960s.
- The Advent of Object-Oriented Programming: (OOP) emerged in the 1980s as a major evolution in software design.
- The Agile Manifesto: The Agile Manifesto was published in 2001, introducing a new set of principles that emphasized iterative development, collaboration, customer feedback, and flexibility in software development.  

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Planning: The software requirements are analyzed and clarified to ensure they align with business objectives.
2. Design: Create the system architecture and detailed design.
3. Development: The actual code for the software is written. Developers implement features and functionality according to the design specifications.
4. Testing: The software is thoroughly tested to ensure it meets the requirements and functions as expected.
5. Deployment: Once the software passes all tests, it is deployed to the production environment, where users can start using it.
6. Maintenance: After deployment, the software enters the maintenance phase, where updates, bug fixes, and new features are added over time.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall is a linear, sequential approach to software development where each phase must be completed before moving on to the next while Agile is an iterative and incremental approach to software development, where work is divided into short cycles or sprints.
In waterfall testin happens after development phase while, in Agile testing happens after each sprint.
Waterfall is suitable for large, well-defined projects, while Agile is suitable for dynamic, evolving projects.
Example of Scenarios;
- Waterfall can be appropriate for Government projects or large-scale construction software systems where the requirements are fixed, thoroughly defined, and unlikely to change during the development process.
- Agile can be appropriate for Startups or software products with evolving requirements. For instance, developing a mobile app or e-commerce platform where customer preferences, market trends, or business needs change rapidly. 

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
- Software Developer: is responsible for designing, coding, and maintaining software systems.
- Quality Assurance Engineer: ensures that the software developed meets the required quality standards. They focus on identifying bugs, issues, and inconsistencies in the software through various testing methods.
- Project Manager: is responsible for overseeing the entire software development lifecycle. They ensure that the project is completed on time, within scope, and within budget, while managing communication between the stakeholders and the development team.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
- An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is a software application that provides tools for writing, debugging, and managing code. IDEs enhance productivity and simplify complex workflows, making them essential for efficient software development.
  Example of an IDE is Visual Studio Code: A lightweight, open-source IDE from Microsoft.
- A Version Control System (VCS) is a tool that helps manage changes to a project's source code over time. It keeps track of every modification made to the codebase, allowing multiple developers to collaborate effectively and ensuring that a complete history of changes is maintained and allow developers to revert to previous versions if necessary.
  Example of a VCS is Git: A distributed VCS that allows developers to work independently on their local machines and then push changes to a shared repository. 

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1. Evolving Technologies and Tools: Technology evolves quickly, and engineers need to constantly learn new frameworks, languages, and tools.
   Strategies: Continuous Learning, Mentorship and Knowledge Sharing, Experiment with new technologies and tools to gain hands-on experience.
2. Debugging and Troubleshooting: Identifying and fixing bugs can be time-consuming and sometimes very complex, especially in large codebases.
   Strategies: Break the Problem Down by testing smaller parts of the code, Use Debugging Tools in IDEs.
3. Collaborating with Non-Technical Teams: Communicating technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders can be challenging.
   Strategies: Clear and concise communication using plain language and avoiding jargon, Using visual aids by utilizing diagrams & charts to illustrate complex ideas.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1. Unit Testing: focuses on  testing individual units or components of the software in isolation.
   Importance: Early Bug Detection - Identifies defects early in the development process, reducing the cost of fixing them later.
2. Integration Testing: examines how different units interact with each other when combined into larger subsystems.
   Importance: Detect Interface defects - Identifies defects that may arise from interactions between different parts of the system.
3.  System Testing: validates the entire system as a whole, simulating real-world usage scenarios.
   Importance: Validates requirements - Verifies that the system meets the specified functional requirements and user expectations.
4. Acceptance Testing:  validates that the software meets the business requirements and is ready for deployment.
   Importance: Ensures Software Meets Expectations - Validates that the system meets the acceptance criteria defined in the requirements.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
- Prompt engineering is the process of structuring an instruction to guide AI models towards generating relevant and accurate responses or outcomes.
Importance: 
Improved Accuracy - A well-crafted prompt can significantly improve the relevance and accuracy of an AI model's response.
Efficiency and Productivity - Effective prompts can reduce the number of iterations needed to achieve desired results, saving time and resources.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
- Vague Prompt: Tell me something about technology
- Improved prompt: Explain how AI has impacted the job market
- The improved prompt is more effective because it specifies the area of technology to focus on and narrows the scope to the job market.
